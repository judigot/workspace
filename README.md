# Workspace

Mobile-first development workspace. Vibe code from your phone — open your app, tap the chat bubble, tell the AI what to change, see it live.

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Initial Setup (Fresh EC2)

You just ran `terraform apply` and have an IP address.

**Step 1 — Bootstrap the system**

SSH into the instance and load the devrc toolchain:

```sh
. <(curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/judigot/user/main/load-devrc.sh?cachebustkey=$(date +%s)")

initubuntu
installnodeenv
usessh
installAWS
useaws
installgithubcli
```

**Step 2 — Clone and run init**

```sh
git clone git@github.com:judigot/workspace.git ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
./scripts/init.sh
```

The wizard prompts for:
- Domain (default: `judigot.com`)
- OpenCode username and password (basic auth)
- Anthropic API key (optional — skip if already configured)

Then it automatically:
1. Installs opencode (via `installOpenCode` from `.devrc`)
2. Issues TLS certificates (`certbot --standalone`)
3. Generates and deploys the nginx config with SSL
4. Creates and starts the `opencode.service` systemd unit
5. Installs dashboard deps and starts the dashboard services

**Step 3 — Open the browser**

| URL | What you see |
|-----|-------------|
| `https://judigot.com` | Dashboard — app grid with live status |
| `https://opencode.judigot.com` | OpenCode (embeddable, used by the chat bubble) |
| `https://workspace.judigot.com` | Dashboard (alias for `judigot.com`) |

---

### Journey 2: Create an App via OpenCode

Open OpenCode at `opencode.judigot.com` (or from the chat bubble inside any app). Ask it to create an app.

> "Create a new React app called my-app"

OpenCode (via the `create-app` agent) will:
1. Scaffold `~/my-app` with Vite + React + TypeScript
2. Configure `vite.config.ts` with the correct base path, HMR, and port
3. Run `~/workspace/scripts/add-app.sh my-app frontend 5177`
4. Start the dev server

Result:
- `https://judigot.com/my-app/` is live
- Dashboard at `judigot.com` shows it with a green status dot
- Tap the card to open it full-screen with the chat bubble

Full-stack apps work too:

> "Create a full-stack app called my-api with a Hono backend"

```sh
# What the agent runs:
~/workspace/scripts/add-app.sh my-api fullstack 3000 5000 ws
```

### Journey 3: Vibe Code from Your Phone

This is the core workflow. You're on your phone, looking at your app.

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      judigot.com        │
│                         │
│  ┌──────┐  ┌─────────┐ │
│  │  OC  │  │scaffolder│ │
│  │  ●   │  │  ●      │ │
│  └──────┘  └─────────┘ │
│                         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Step 1** — Tap the scaffolder card. The browser navigates to `judigot.com/scaffolder/` — a native page, not an iframe.

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  judigot.com/scaffolder │
│                         │
│     Your app runs as    │
│     a native page       │
│     (no iframe)         │
│                         │
│                  🟣      │
│                  bubble  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

The DevBubble widget is automatically injected into the page by nginx (`sub_filter`). No app code changes required.

**Step 2** — You see something you want to change. Tap the chat bubble (bottom-right). OpenCode opens fullscreen over the app.

**Step 3** — Tell it what you want:

> "Change the header background to red"

OpenCode edits the code. Vite HMR picks up the change. **You see it instantly.**

**Step 4** — Tap minimize. You're back to your app with the change applied. Keep going.

This is the loop:

```
Look at app → Tap bubble → Tell AI what to change → See it live → Repeat
```

No editor. No terminal. No laptop. Just your phone and the running app.

---

### Journey 4: Open an Existing App

Go to `judigot.com`. The dashboard shows all registered apps with live status:

- **Green dot** = dev server is running
- **Gray dot** = dev server is stopped
- **OC card** = opens OpenCode in a new tab

Tap any app card — the browser navigates directly to the app URL (e.g. `judigot.com/scaffolder/`). The app runs as a native page with full Auth0/cookie support (no iframe restrictions).

The **DevBubble** widget appears on every app page (bottom-right, draggable):
- Tap to expand — opens a fullscreen panel with OpenCode + URL bar + Home button
- Tap Home — navigates back to the dashboard
- Enter a URL in the URL bar — navigates the browser to that address
- Tap minimize — collapse back to bubble

The bubble is draggable like a Messenger chat head. It is the **only control surface** on app pages — no top nav bar, no standalone back button.

**How it works:** Nginx uses `sub_filter` to inject a `<script>` tag into every app's HTML response before `</body>`. The script loads a self-contained widget bundle (`/dev-bubble.js`) that creates the bubble and panel entirely in vanilla JS — no React, no build dependency on the host app.

---

### Journey 5: Add an App Manually

```sh
# Frontend only (Vite)
~/workspace/scripts/add-app.sh my-app 5177

# Full-stack (Vite frontend + API backend + websockets)
~/workspace/scripts/add-app.sh my-api fullstack 3000 5000 ws

# Laravel
~/workspace/scripts/add-app.sh admin laravel 8000
```

The dashboard picks up new apps automatically (reads `.env` live).

---

### Journey 6: Re-run init (Idempotent)

```sh
cd ~/workspace && ./scripts/init.sh
```

Reads `.env` for defaults. Skips certs if they already cover all domains. Restarts services cleanly.

## Architecture

```
judigot.com (+ workspace.judigot.com alias)
        │
        ▼
   Nginx (:443, SSL)
        │
        ├─ /              → Dashboard Vite (:3200)  ← app grid
        ├─ /api/*         → Dashboard Hono API (:3100)
        │                   reads .env, checks port health
        ├─ /dev-bubble.js → Static widget bundle (/var/www/static/)
        ├─ /<slug>/       → App Vite frontend + sub_filter injects DevBubble widget
        ├─ /<slug>/api/   → App backend API (fullstack only)
        ├─ /<slug>/ws     → App websocket (fullstack+ws)
        └─ /<slug>/       → App backend + sub_filter (laravel)

opencode.judigot.com → OpenCode (:4097, auth injected by nginx)
```

**DevBubble injection (nginx `sub_filter`):**

For every app location, nginx rewrites the HTML response:
```
sub_filter '</body>' '<script src="/dev-bubble.js" data-opencode-url="..." data-dashboard-url="..."></script></body>';
```
The widget is self-contained vanilla JS — no React, no dependencies on the host app.

**The vibe-coding loop:**

```
Phone → judigot.com → tap app card → browser navigates to /scaffolder/
                                                │
                                      app loads as native page
                                      DevBubble widget injected by nginx
                                                │
                                      tap bubble → OpenCode panel (fullscreen)
                                                │
                                      "change X" → AI edits code
                                                │
                                      Vite HMR → change visible instantly
                                                │
                                      minimize → back to app
```
